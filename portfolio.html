                        <p class="card-text">Since 2017 I have had the distinct pleasure of touring with the wildly entertaining blues/soul artist, Dana Fuchs from Harlem, NY. Dana played the character, "Sexy Sadie" in the cult classic, "Across The Universe." Dana has a distinct rasp in her voice many compare to Janis Joplin while remaining smooth and soulful. We can be seen and heard all across the United States and Europe.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Since 2018 psychedelic soul and Americana singer-songwriter, Nicole Atkins and I have been hitting stages all over the United States together. Nicole is often compared to Roy Orbison and many others from the 1950's "crooner" era as well as 1960's pschedelic soul. She is coined with "The Golden Voice." Her charming delivery and deep rooted vocals bring listeners to a different time and space.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Gedeon and the band are an act to see. Forget about your day job. Forget about your struggles you're going to be hit with a wall of "Peace, Love and Soul." Gedeon grew up in Memphis and grasped the attention of producers all over the country when he made it to the final round of "American Idol" some years back. Its a big ole' soul band fusing Funk, Soul, Rock, Blues and Gospel music.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">I got a call to do a music video with a metal band from Norway. I dont play metal! I did it and it lead to me getting hired by the guitarist Mike Orlando of "Adrenaline Mob" and vocalist Corey Glover of "Living Colour." Their original music was a fusion of hard rock, metal, and almost composition-like classical music. To say the least that was one of the most rewarding and challenging gigs I have ever done. It really took me time to step up to the plate and learn all of those technical lines and time signatures. I will surely not forget that experience and cannot wait to do more with both of them!</p>

                              <p class="card-text">Retro-Pop Duo Fly By Midnight out of New York City. I have the pleasure of doing a bunch with these guys. They write and produce EVERYTHING in house. You dont find that with many acts these days. These guys have got the feel good-upbeat jams that keep you movin'. We hit a bunch of great festivals and venues together including Firefly Music Festival, Panorama Music Festival, and the Rainbow Room.</p>

                                <p class="card-body">Most of our days as bass players revolve around supporting a vocalist and soloists. There MAY-BE one time during the show that they "give the bass player some." When you're called on to take your solo are you going to be ready for it? I can help work you through leaving your bass player roots and have soaring melodic solos that will even capitvate some horn players (probably not)!</p>
